    Class that models the <https://github.com/biotomas/ipasir/blob/master/ipasir.h ipasir.h> interface.
    This class is meant to be implemented using foreign function interfaces to the actual C solver.
    In most cases the type @a@ will be a @newtype@ around a 'ForeignPtr'.
    
    A solver can be in different states (see 'SolverState'). Notice, that every function ending with
    a dash (like 'ipasirAdd'') is not state secure. That means: It is not checked if the solver is in 
    a valid state to execute the function and the state doesn\'t update.
    
    These state unsafe functions are just for the devolopers, who wants to instantiate more solvers.
    Dont use these functions from outside. Every state unsafe functions has a pendant without a dash.
